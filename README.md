# screenshotSN

Take screenshots of your computer, and get GPT-4o to analyse the content of the
screen. The idea is that if we ran this every minute, I could have a precise
read of my computer activity, and potentially use this as data for a "genuine
connection" social network that would share with my friends stuff like "Today
Thomas listened to these podcasts, watched this movie, and did research on
asteroid mining."

## Cost analysis
10 requests led to 10152 input tokens and 2624 output tokens, this means it
costs 9 cents per screenshot analysed. This means it costs about $40/day to do
this, which is currently too cost prohibitive. Once costs are down by a factor
of 100x this could be a viable idea.
